# demand-planning-forecasting

In a context of high uncertainty, demand planning aims to estimate customer demand over a strategic horizon that can extend up to 18 months. These forecasts are critical to anticipate supply planning and production decisions, helping to mitigate the risks of overstocking and stockouts.

Accurate demand forecasting across a large portfolio of SKUs is a key challenge in supply chain planning. This project focuses on building scalable machine learning models capable of forecasting demand for multiple SKUs simultaneously, while capturing seasonality, trends and demand variability.
